events in poll()

POLLIN There is data to read.

POLLPRI
       There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band data on TCP socket; pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen state change in slave).

POLLOUT
       Writing now will not block.

POLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17)
       Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection.  The _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined (before including any header files) in order to obtain this defini‐
       tion.

POLLERR
       Error condition (output only).

POLLHUP
       Hang up (output only).

POLLNVAL
       Invalid request: fd not open (output only).

POLLRDBAND     Priority data may be read without blocking.

POLLRDNORM     Normal data may be read without blocking.

POLLWRBAND     Priority data may be written without blocking.

POLLWRNORM     Normal data may be written without blocking.

//redis ae_epoll.c
if (e->events & EPOLLIN) mask |= AE_READABLE;
if (e->events & EPOLLOUT) mask |= AE_WRITABLE;
if (e->events & EPOLLERR) mask |= AE_WRITABLE;
if (e->events & EPOLLHUP) mask |= AE_WRITABLE;


//unp
1. 向已经收到RST的socket写数据，会收到SIGPIPE信号，会终止进程，同时写操作会返回EPIPE错误
2. server崩溃，client没有收到FIN，client 先write后read，tcp会重传，最后返回ETIMEDOUT，或者EHOSTUNREACH/ENETUNREACH（路由器判断主机不可达）
3. 2的情况下，server崩溃后重启，返回 ECONNRESET （p115）
4. select 返回的就绪条件，如果有一个错误，即可读也可写，读写返回-1，同时设置errno为错误条件，也可以通过SO_ERROR 调用获取并清除。（p130）


//
poll/epoll对于 socket异常事件的处理。
如果由handleRead()处理，在connector中有可能刚连上server，server写数据，导致读到了应用的数据。
如果由handleWrite()处理，Loop中并不会一直关注write事件
所以还是单独触发handleError()

//
A POLLHUP means the socket is no longer connected. In TCP, this means FIN has been received and sent.
//todo 是否应该不再关注read，对httpserver ab test发现 shutdownWrite到最终close 会反复触发此事件
A POLLERR means the socket got an asynchronous error. In TCP, this typically means a RST has been received or sent. If the file descriptor is not a socket, POLLERR might mean the device does not support polling.

For both of the conditions above, the socket file descriptor is still open, and has not yet been closed (but shutdown() may have already been called). A close() on the file descriptor will release resources that are still being reserved on behalf of the socket. In theory, it should be possible to reuse the socket immediately (e.g., with another connect() call).

A POLLNVAL means the socket file descriptor is not open. It would be an error to close() it.
